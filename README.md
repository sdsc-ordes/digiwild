# Digiwild

# Citizen-Science Wilf Life Monitoring 
## Bird Monitoring Use-Case

## About

This work stemmed from a fruitful collaboration between [Swiss Data Science Center](https://www.datascience.ch) and [Institute for Fish and Wildlife Health, University of Bern](https://www.fiwi.vetsuisse.unibe.ch).
The resulting [Gradio App is available to use on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SDSC/digiwild), which is coupled to the [digiwild Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SDSC/digiwild-dataset). 
Credits and special thanks for the project can be found in the `About` section of the app.
